## Reason why we only work on JabRef
In the beginning, we chose to work on two major repositories - JabRef and Halo. However, in the process of fix issues in these two repositories, we have found that the attitudes and enthusiasms of administrators of the two repositories are completely different. The administrators of the other repository Halo seem to be absent and passive. Many pull requests which we and other developers submitted are not be answered for a long period of time so that we could not get any feedback from the repository Halo. In contrast, the administrators of the repository JabRef are active all the time. All the pull requests which we have submitted would be replied immediately in several days of the same week. As a result, we have got a lot of feedbacks from the repository JabRef. In consequence, we decided to drop the repository Halo and fix issues in the repository JabRef only.
